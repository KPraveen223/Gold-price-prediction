This R script performs a comprehensive analysis on a dataset related to gold prices and various economic indicators. Here's a summary of the key steps and operations:

1. Loading Required Libraries and Reading Data
   - The script installs and loads several R packages (`readxl`, `DescTools`, `readr`, `openxlsx`, `tidyverse`, `car`, `lmtest`, `forecast`, `tseries`, and `lubridate`).
   - The dataset "GoldUP.csv" is read into R using `read.csv()`.

2. **Initial Data Inspection
   - The internal structure of the dataset is examined using `str(data)`.
   - The dataset is attached to the R environment for easy access to variables.

3. Correlation Analysis
   - Correlation between the gold price and other economic variables (e.g., Crude Oil, Interest Rate, USD/INR, Sensex, CPI, USD Index) is computed using `cor()`.

4. Descriptive Statistics
   - Summary statistics (`summary()`), standard deviation (`sd()`), interquartile range (`IQR`), and variance (`var()`) for the variables are calculated.
  
5. Linear Regression Analysis
   - A full linear regression model (`fullfit`) is built with Gold Price as the dependent variable and other economic indicators as predictors.
   - A reduced model (`reducedfit`) is created by excluding the USD Index.
   - The fit of the models is examined using plots of residuals vs. fitted values.

6. Handling Heteroscedasticity
   - The response variable (Gold Price) is log-transformed to remove heteroscedasticity, and a new model (`fit1`) is built.
   - The `step()` function is used for stepwise regression to refine the model (`fit2`).
   - Multicollinearity is checked using Variance Inflation Factors (`vif()`).

7. Correlation Matrix
   - A correlation matrix for the independent variables is calculated and stored in `cor_matrix`.

8. Time Series Analysis
   - The Gold Price data is converted into a time series (`ts_data`).
   - The stationarity of the time series is checked using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test (`adf.test()`).
   - Auto-correlation (`acf()`) and partial auto-correlation (`pacf()`) plots are generated.
   - An ARIMA model (`model`) is fitted to the time series data.
   - The model is used to predict future Gold Prices, and the predictions are plotted.

9. Plotting
   - Various plots are generated to visualize the relationships, trends, and seasonality in the data, including residual plots, time series plots, and boxplots.

This script provides a robust analysis of the relationship between gold prices and various economic factors, utilizing both linear regression and time series modeling.
